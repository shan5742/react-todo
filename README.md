This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Todo List

This is a simple Todo list app made with React via create-react-app. I have opted to style the app simply with materialize, so that I could focus on the app itself rather than spending too much time styling.

### Future

I plan to add more sophisticated styling to the whole app as well as adding more space for clicking to remove and maybe a label there too.
